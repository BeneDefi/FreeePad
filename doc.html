                <h3>Freepad addresses critical issues in the crypto space, such as scams, rug-pulls, and high participation thresholds.</h3>
                <h1>FreePad Launchpad</h1>
                <h2>Simplifying Fundraising</h2>
                <p>Freepad is a groundbreaking, token-free launchpad designed to make decentralized fundraising accessible to everyone. By eliminating entry barriers and introducing robust user protection measures, Freepad addresses critical issues in the crypto space, such as scams, rug-pulls, and high participation thresholds.</p>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>FreePad is a novel multi-chain fundraising platform with no high-cost entry barriers and user protection at its core. The only requirement to participate in our presales is to mint a one-time NFT for $20 and register for the presale during the registration period. All investments have a 48-hour refund policy from TGE. A tokenless launchpad represents a shift toward simplicity, inclusivity, and transparency. Removing the unnecessary layer of Launchpad's native tokens enables more efficient capital formation, strengthens trust in the ecosystem, and ensures that the focus remains on fostering innovative, high-quality projects.
                </p> <br><br>
                <p>The Web3 space is maturing, and with it comes the demand for smarter, user-friendly solutions. A tokenless launchpad is not just an idea; it’s the next logical evolution in decentralized project fundraising and incubation.</p> <br> <br>
                <p>Let’s build a future—where projects and communities thrive without the unnecessary baggage of token-centric models.</p>
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make Defi investing accessible to all with no entry barrier.</li>
                    <li>To make Defi investing safer by having strong user protection with up to 48 hours of refund policy.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessible Participation:</strong><p>Users can register and join IDOs without the need to stake or hold tokens provided they mint a one-time $20 Freepad NFT.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Fair Allocation:</strong><p>Registered participants receive a maximum allocation of $100 in the first sales round, with subsequent rounds offering increased flexibility.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent Revenue Model:</strong><p>50% of revenue generated on all successful launches for that month goes back to compensating the Trustpad tier holders/stakers. The other 50% is used for the team wages, marketing, and continued development of the project. Revenue sharing will shift from Trustpad users to the general community after a certain threshold is reached.</p></li>

                <h3>Why Freepad?</h3>
                    <p>The platform is designed to protect users through its SAFU policy, ensuring safety in every sale. With no entry barriers and a focus on decentralization, Freepad provides a secure and inclusive environment for crypto investors of all levels.</p>
                    <h3>Why a Tokenless Launchpad is the Next Big Thing in Web3</h3>
                    <p>The blockchain ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and innovation continues to reshape how projects raise capital and engage with their communities. Among the emerging trends, a tokenless launchpad stands out as a groundbreaking paradigm, poised to redefine fundraising and project incubation in the decentralized space.</p><br><br>
                    <em>Here are compelling reasons why a tokenless launchpad is the next big thing:</em><br><br>
                <h4>1. Eliminating the Complexity of Dual Tokens</h4>
                    <p>Traditional launchpads typically issue their tokens to facilitate participation. While this can create utility within their ecosystems, it often introduces unnecessary complexity and speculation. A tokenless launchpad removes this friction:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No dependency on native token volatility:</strong><p>Participants are no longer at the mercy of market fluctuations of the launchpad’s token.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Participants are no longer at the mercy of market fluctuations of the launchpad’s token.</strong><p>Users can focus on the project they’re supporting without needing to acquire and manage an additional token.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Broad accessibility:</strong><p>Participants can engage using native blockchain tokens (e.g., ETH, BNB) or stablecoins, making the process more inclusive and intuitive.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>2. Trust and Transparency</h4>
                    <p>One of the core values of blockchain technology is trustlessness. Ironically, many launchpads create centralized dependencies by requiring their tokens for participation. A tokenless model fosters transparency by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reducing conflicts of interest:</strong><p>Launchpads no longer have incentives to manipulate or prioritize their native token’s performance.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Aligning incentives:</strong><p>The launchpad’s success is directly tied to the success of projects, not token trading volumes or speculative hype.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Fair participation mechanisms:</strong><p>Focus shifts toward ensuring equitable access to quality projects instead of token-based tier systems, which often favor whales.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>3. Increased Focus on Project Quality</h4>
                    <p>Without the distraction of promoting a native token, a tokenless launchpad can channel its efforts into vetting and incubating high-quality projects.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced due diligence:</strong><p>Resources can be allocated to screening teams, roadmaps, and technical feasibility.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Community-centric approach</strong><p>Success is measured by the value delivered to both projects and participants, not token metrics.</p></li>
                        <li><strong> Improved outcomes:</strong><p>A strong focus on fundamentals reduces the risk of scams and improves long-term project viability.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>4. Lower Barriers to Entry for Projects</h4>
                <p>Requiring projects to integrate with a launchpad’s token often introduces unnecessary friction. A tokenless model benefits projects by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simplified fundraising process:</strong><p>Startups can raise funds in widely used cryptocurrencies or stablecoins</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Greater flexibility:</strong><p>Projects don’t need to adopt external tokenomics that might conflict with their models.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Wider audience reach:</strong><p>By eliminating token requirements, launchpads can attract a more diverse base of investors and supporters.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>5. Sustainability and Long-Term Vision</h4>
                <p>Tokenless launchpads are inherently designed for long-term value creation rather than short-term speculative gains. This makes them more resilient in volatile market conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoiding pump-and-dump cycles:</strong><p>Without a launchpad token, the ecosystem is insulated from the speculative booms and busts that often plague token-based platforms.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on utility and innovation:</strong><p>By decoupling from token economics, launchpads can prioritize sustainable growth and ecosystem development.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>6. Aligning with Web3 Principles</h4>
                <p>The Web3 ethos centers around decentralization, user empowerment, and interoperability. A tokenless launchpad aligns perfectly with these principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decentralized access:</strong><p>Anyone can participate using universally accepted tokens, fostering inclusivity.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong><p>The model can seamlessly integrate across blockchains without imposing additional token dependencies.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>User-first design:</strong><p>The focus is on empowering users and projects rather than creating isolated token silos.</p></li>
                </ul> <br><br>
                <h4>7. Tokenomics/Revenue</h4>
                <p>Freepad will make use of the following strategies to generate revenue:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>One-time NFT mint for $100:</strong><p>Freepad will have a total of 100M nontransferable NFTs based on one per wallet. To participate in our sales, users are required to mint a one-time NFT for $100. This NFT gives the wallet access to all sales on Freepad with a minimum of $100 in guaranteed initial allocation.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Launchpad application fee:</strong><p>All projects applying to raise funds on Freepad are required to pay a non-refundable fee. This is to ensure that there is no abuse of the application process and ensure only legitimate projects send in requests.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Advertisement fees:</strong><p>Freepad will charge any projects wishing to advertise on its platform or use any of our services a certain fee. These goes into the treasury and project development.</p></li>
                </ol> <br> <br>
                <h3>User Protection Policy (SAFU)</h3>
                    <p>Freepad will adopt user self-protection model for all its sales. Users can choose between a full refund for any sale within 48 hours post-TGE provided no token was claimed.</p> <br> <br>
                <!-- <h3>Extras</h3>
                    <p>Users can acquire more allocation by participating in campaigns aimed at making users more familiar with the projects they're investing in. These campaigns will run daily for a given period. Earned points will be converted to extra allocation for the users.</p> -->

                <h3>Trustpad holders/stakers compensation</h3>
                    <p>$TPAD V2 stakers/holders will be compensated with 50% of revenue generated from successful sales for that month. Compensation will follow the Trustpad's tier weight model. This compensation will continue until a certain threshold is reached.</p>
                <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                    <p>The user must have participated in at least 75% of sales for the month under review to be eligible for the compensation.</p>
                <h3>What happened to Trustpad?</h3>
                    <p>The Trustpad team was composed of anonymous individuals using pseudonyms, with Lechiffre as the Founder and Double Trouble as the CTO. Unfortunately, Trustpad has not made any sales in the last 6 months. Neither Lechiffre nor DT has provided any reasons for the inactivity, and none of the remaining active team members, including myself, know their current whereabouts. There is growing concern within the Trustpad community about whether this marks the end of the project. I honestly don't know. Only time will tell.</p> <br> <br>
                    <p>On a separate note, Freepad is an independent project that I built from scratch. With over five years of experience in the launchpad business, I have gained enough knowledge to tackle the significant challenges faced by launchpads, investors, and projects seeking to raise funds.</p> <br> <br>
                    <p>While I am grateful to Trustpad for the opportunity it provided and remain committed to its present and future, I must now continue my journey with my new venture, Freepad.</p> <br> <br>
                <h3>Partners</h3>
                    <p>We welcome all SaaS, KOLs, MM, VCs, and all stakeholders into Freepad. The benefits are enormous for all our partners. We will be having special pools dedicated to our early-stage supporters, investors, and partners.</p>
